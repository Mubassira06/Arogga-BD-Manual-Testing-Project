ðŸ“‹ Arogga BD Manual Testing Project
A detailed manual testing project covering critical modules of Arogga BD, an online pharmacy platform, with documented test artifacts and actionable insights.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project involves end-to-end manual testing of Arogga BD, focusing on 11 core modules and 20+ critical features. The goal was to validate functionality, identify defects, and propose improvements to enhance user experience.

ðŸ”‘ Highlights
250+ test cases designed and executed across 11 modules.

19 failed test cases translated into detailed bug reports.

Test metrics, scenarios, mind maps, and improvement scopes documented.

Tools: Google Sheets (test cases, metrics, bug reports), XMind (mind maps).
